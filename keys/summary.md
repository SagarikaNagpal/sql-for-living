# What is key in DBMS: 
. A key in DBMS is an attribute or set of attributes which helps you to identify a row(tuple) in a relation(table)
. Keys in RDBMS allow you to establish a relationship between and identify the relation between tables
. Eight types of key in DBMS are Super, Primary, Candidate, Alternate, Foreign, Compound, Composite, and Surrogate Key.
. A super key is a group of single or multiple keys which identifies rows in a table.
. A column or group of columns in a table which helps us to uniquely identifies every row in that table is called a primary key
. All the different keys in DBMS which are not primary key are called an alternate key
. A super key with no repeated attribute is called candidate key
. A compound key is a key which has many fields which allow you to uniquely recognize a specific record
. A key which has multiple attributes to uniquely identify rows in a table is called a composite key
. An artificial key which aims to uniquely identify each record is called a surrogate key
. Primary Key never accept null values while a foreign key may accept multiple null values.
