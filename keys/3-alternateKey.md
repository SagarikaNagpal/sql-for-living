#  What is the Alternate key?
ALTERNATE KEYS is a column or group of columns in a table that uniquely identify every row in that table. A table can have multiple choices for a primary key but only one can be set as the primary key. All the keys which are not primary key are called an Alternate Key.

Example:

In this table, StudID, Roll No, Email are qualified to become a primary key. But since StudID is the primary key, Roll No, Email becomes the alternative key.

StudID	Roll No	First Name	LastName	Email
1	11	Tom	Price	abc@gmail.com
2	12	Nick	Wright	xyz@gmail.com
3	13	Dana	Natan	mno@yahoo.com
