# What are Keys in DBMS?
1. Keys in DBMS is a set of attribute which helps us to find the relationship between the tables.
2. they help us to find the row and the combination of columns.
3. It also helps us to find the unique records(row/column) in the table.

Employee ID	FirstName	LastName
11	Andrew	Johnson
22	Tom	Wood
33	Alex	Hale

In the above-given example, employee ID is a primary key because it uniquely identifies an employee record. In this table, no other employee can have the same employee ID.
