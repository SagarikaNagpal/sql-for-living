# What is the Compound key?

COMPOUND KEY has two or more attributes that allow you to uniquely recognize a specific record. It is possible that each column may not be unique by itself within the database. However, when combined with the other column or columns the combination of composite keys become unique. The purpose of the compound key in database is to uniquely identify each record in the table.

Example:

OrderNo	PorductID	Product Name	Quantity
B005	JAP102459	Mouse	5
B005	DKT321573	USB	10
B005	OMG446789	LCD Monitor	20
B004	DKT321573	USB	15
B002	OMG446789	Laser Printer	3
In this example, OrderNo and ProductID canâ€™t be a primary key as it does not uniquely identify a record. However, a compound key of Order ID and Product ID could be used as it uniquely identified each record.
